# dash_wildfires
A repository for a group project on the BALADRIA 2025 Summer School. Please note that the data this repository contains is fake.

The repository contains the data and code necessary to generate the distribution data (gen_dists.py), run sentiment analysis (get_sents.py) and topic modelling (get_topics.py) and to then visualise it using Streamlit (navigate to directory with app.py and run command streamlit run app.py).
